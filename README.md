# Example-3.5

A breakroom is to be located in the fifth floor of an office complex that houses 
four departments of the Social Security Administration. Coordinates of the centroid of each department as well as the average number of trips made per day between each department and the yet-to-be-determined breakroom location are known and given in Table 3.15. Assume that travel originates and ends at the centroid of each department. Determine the optimal location—the x and y coordinates—for the breakroom.
